    "## More comprehensive description\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maezmo:** Not really a rank, but brand new wrestlers get introduced in a special ceremony and fight a 7-day tournament just amongst themselves to see where they get placed in the lowest official ranking. Gives them a taste for how a tournament goes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Jonokuchi, Jonidan, and Sandanme:** These are all beginner rankings. The names roughly mean \"Beginning step\", \"2nd beginning grade\", and \"3rd grade\". Everyone here is getting their skills. Most wrestlers here are quite young. Professional sumo training starts as early as 15 years of age. You can also find older wrestlers or wrestlers who were out with injuries for several tournaments and fell hard.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Makushita:** This is the top of the non-salaried rankings and is fixed at 60 ranks (120 wrestlers). The name literally means \"below the curtain\". This is a hard division. Breaking out of this rank into the next one is the tipping point between getting a salary or not. If you do especially well in this rank (7-0 records) then you can get a huge boost either within Makushita or go directly to the next rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Juryo:** The name derives from an old unit of payment and means that the wrestlers are getting paid. Juryo is fixed at 14 ranks (28 wrestlers). This rank is full of up-and-comers mixed with people falling down from Maegashira. Main goal for this rank, don't fall down out of it. You don't keep getting paid if you leave it! Also, all ranks from here on fight the full 15 days. Juryo matches used to be televised, but not so much these days.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Side note:** All the ranks above Juryo are upper division ranks (Makuuchi, \"inside the curtain\"). Wrestlers get many more privileges at this point. They also get televised on NHK. Most wrestlers you hear about will have hit this division.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maegashira:** Roughly means \"those in front.\" NHK likes to call this division \"rank-and-filers\", though as you can see from the number of people they've surpassed that's not quite accurate. At maximum, there are 16 ranks (32 wrestlers) in the Maegashira division. If there are more people in higher ranks, there are fewer Maegashira ranks to keep the 42 wrestler total.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Side note:** These last ranks are called san'yaku, or titleholder ranks. Even if a wrestler drops out of these ranks, they will be known by the highest rank they achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Komusubi:** \"The little knot\". There must always be two wrestlers at this rank. More can be added if a Maegashira does so well that the banzuke creators deem they can't be denied promotion. The reason is that the rank is called a knot is that a wrestler at this rank has to either wait for a space to open up at the next rank or do so well that they can't be denied a promotion (think 11+ wins). Quite possibly the hardest rank to hold out of all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sekiwake:** \"At the side of the barrier\". Also must always be two wrestlers at this rank. To progress from here, the standard is 33 wins across three consecutive tournaments. Thus, they have to win 73.33% of the time in three matches without getting make-kochi. Very difficult to do. There is also an separate committee that looks at the wrestler's history to see if their comportment and prowess are worthy of the promotion to...\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ozeki:** \"Great Barrier\". Used to be the highest rank before Yokozuna. Losing this rank requires two losing tournaments in a row. A single losing tournament puts an Ozeki into a status called \"kadoban\".If they get a winning tournament, the status is lifted. If he loses again, it's back to Sekiwake. If they can get 10 wins in the next tournament, they'll get their Ozeki status again. If they can't, they'll have to start the process to getting to Ozeki all over again.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Yokozuna:** \"Horizontal Rope\", after the tsuna they wear in their special entrance ceremony. The current standard to achieve this rank is to win two back-to-back tournaments as an Ozeki. They must also undergo a stringent examination of character by both the Sumo Association and a body of laypeople called the Yokozuna Deliberation Council. Once they are promoted, they cannot be demoted. However, if they cannot uphold the rank they are expected to retire from the sport. There have only been 72 wrestlers to officially achieve this rank in all of Sumo's history.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ranking before 1995\n",
    "\n",
    "**haridashi** (張り出し)\n",
    "Overhang. If there are more than two wrestlers at any san'yaku rank, the additional wrestlers are termed haridashi. Prior to 1995, such wrestlers were listed on the banzuke in extensions or \"overhangs\" to the row for makuuchi wrestlers. This is now an informal designation, since presently all wrestlers are listed within the normal bounds of the row. __[(link)](https://sumowrestling.fandom.com/wiki/Glossary_of_Sumo_Terms)__\n",
